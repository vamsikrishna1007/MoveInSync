# Time Series Forecasting Project

## Overview
This project includes a Jupyter Notebook (`time-series-final-code.ipynb`) designed for time series analysis and forecasting. The notebook provides an end-to-end pipeline to process, train models, and forecast data. It is customizable to work with your own data files.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

### Installation
Clone the Repository: Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.
Navigate to the Project Folder: Change to the directory where the notebook is located.
Open the Notebook: Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

### How to Use
Prepare Your Data
Ensure that your data files are formatted as CSV or a compatible format. They should include a timestamp column and a value column for forecasting
Run the Notebook
Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially. The notebook will:

- `Load your data`
- `Preprocess it as needed`
- `Train a forecasting model`
- `Generate predictions and visualizations`
